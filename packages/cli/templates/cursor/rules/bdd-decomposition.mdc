# Phase 5: Technical Decomposition

**Entry:** `decomposition` phase (after scenarios validated)

## Analyze Scenarios

1. **Identify components:**
   - UI components
   - API endpoints
   - Data models
   - Business logic modules

2. **Assign test layers:**
   - Pure logic (no I/O) → unit test
   - API boundaries, database → integration test
   - User flows → E2E test

3. **Create task breakdown** (order by dependencies):
   - Data models first
   - Business logic second
   - API endpoints third
   - UI components fourth
   - E2E tests last

4. **Present to user** — Show components, test layers, task order

## Complex Features

3+ components, new tech choices, or schema changes may need docs first:

- Feature-level → design-doc-guide.md
- Cross-cutting → architecture-guide.md

## Phase 5 Exit (REQUIRED)

1. Task breakdown documented in ticket
2. Update frontmatter: `phase: implement`
3. Add work log: `- {timestamp} Complete: Phase 5 - Decomposed into {N} tasks`
