# Phase 0-2: Context Check & Discovery

**Entry:** Feature-level work OR ticket at `intake` phase.

## Context Check

1. **Read spec** (or note if missing)
2. **Check for goal AND scope sections**
3. **If missing** → ask:
   - "What's the goal? What should users be able to do?"
   - "What's in scope? What are we building?"
   - "What's explicitly out of scope?"
4. **Create/update spec** with answers

**Exit:** Spec has goal AND scope sections.

## Discovery (Optional)

After context check, offer:

> "Want to spitball edge cases before we dive in?"

**If user accepts** → run discovery rounds:

1. Round 1: User experience ("What does success feel like?")
2. Round 2: Failure modes ("What breaks?")
3. Round 3: Boundaries ("What's the minimum? Maximum?")
4. Round 4: Scenarios ("Walk through a concrete situation")
5. Round 5: Regret ("If we skip this, what support tickets come?")

After each round: "Another round or ready?"

**Max 5 rounds** → then proceed automatically.

**Exit:** User says "ready" OR max rounds → update to `define-behavior`.
