## Templates

Fillable structures for feature documentation:

| Template                        | Purpose                                          | Used By             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |

| **work-log-template.md**        | Scratch pad and working memory during execution  | SAFEWORD.md         |

## Planning Structure

Feature planning and design documentation lives in `.safeword/planning/`:

```text
planning/
├── specs/              Feature and task specs
├── test-definitions/   Test definition documents
├── design/             Design docs and research
├── issues/             Issue capture and tracking
├── plans/              LLM-ready execution plans
└── archive/            Completed work
```

## Learnings

Extracted knowledge that compounds across sessions:

**Location**: `.safeword/learnings/[concept].md`

**What goes here**:

- Debugging discoveries (non-obvious gotchas, integration struggles)
- Trial-and-error findings (tried 3+ approaches before right one)
- Architecture insights (discovered during implementation)
- Testing traps (tests pass but UX broken, or vice versa)

**How to extract**: Follow `learning-extraction.md` recognition triggers and templates
