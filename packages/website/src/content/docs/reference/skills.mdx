Skills are structured workflows that kick in automatically when your agent recognizes certain tasks. You don't invoke them directly—they activate based on what you're asking for.

**How it works:** When you say "debug this test failure" or "refactor this function", your agent recognizes the pattern and follows the skill's methodology instead of jumping straight to code changes.

| Skill             | Triggers on                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Brainstorming     | "design", "explore options", "think through"  |
| Debugging         | "debug", "fix this error", "test is failing"  |
| TDD               | "implement", "add feature", "build"           |
| BDD               | Complex features touching 3+ files            |
| Quality Reviewing | "review", "check security", "verify versions" |
| Refactoring       | "refactor", "clean up", "extract", "rename"   |
| Writing Plans     | "write plan", "break down into tasks"         |

## Brainstorming

Helps you think through a problem before writing code. Asks clarifying questions, explores alternatives, and validates assumptions incrementally.

**Example:** "I need to add caching but I'm not sure how to approach it"

Your agent will ask questions like "What's the cache invalidation strategy?" and "Should this be in-memory or distributed?" before proposing solutions.

---

## Debugging

Investigates before fixing. Follows: **Investigate** → **Hypothesize** → **Test** → **Fix**.

**Example:** "This test is failing but I don't know why"

Instead of immediately changing code, your agent will read the test, trace the execution path, form a hypothesis, and verify it before making changes.

---

## TDD (Test-Driven Development)

Enforces the discipline of writing tests first: **RED** (failing test) → **GREEN** (make it pass) → **REFACTOR** (clean up).

**Example:** "Add a function that validates email addresses"

Your agent will write the test first, run it to see it fail, then write the minimum code to make it pass.

---

## BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

For complex features that span multiple files. Follows: **Discovery** → **Define Scenarios** → **Decompose** → **Implement**.

**Example:** "Add user authentication with OAuth"

Your agent will first define the expected behavior with Given/When/Then scenarios, break it into tasks, then implement each task using TDD.

---

## Quality Reviewing

Deep review that checks your code against current best practices using web search.

**Example:** "Review this authentication code"

Your agent will check against official library docs, look for known security issues, and verify you're using current versions.

---

## Refactoring

Small, safe changes with test verification after each step: **One change** → **Test** → **Commit**.

**Example:** "Clean up this messy function"

Your agent will make one small improvement, run tests, commit, then repeat—never batching multiple changes.

---

## Writing Plans

Creates detailed implementation plans before coding. Useful for complex features that need coordination.

**Example:** "Plan out how we'd add multi-tenancy"

Your agent will produce a step-by-step plan with file paths, code examples, and verification steps.
