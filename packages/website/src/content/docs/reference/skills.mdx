# Skills

Skills are structured workflows that guide AI agents through specific tasks. They enforce discipline and best practices.

## Available Skills

| `safeword-brainstorming`    | "brainstorm", "design", "explore options"    | Collaborative design through Socratic questioning |
| `safeword-debugging`        | "debug", "fix error", "test failing"         | Four-phase debugging (investigate before fixing)  |
| `safeword-enforcing-tdd`    | "implement", "add", "build", "fix"           | RED → GREEN → REFACTOR discipline                 |

## Skill Details

### safeword-brainstorming

Use before implementation when refining rough ideas into specs. Guides collaborative design through:

- Socratic questioning
- Alternative exploration
- Incremental validation

### safeword-debugging

Four-phase debugging framework that ensures root cause identification **before** fixes:

1. **Investigate** - Gather information
2. **Hypothesize** - Form theories
3. **Test** - Validate hypotheses
4. **Fix** - Apply solution

### safeword-enforcing-tdd

Enforces strict RED → GREEN → REFACTOR test discipline:

1. **RED** - Write failing test first
2. **GREEN** - Minimum code to pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve while tests pass

### safeword-quality-reviewer

Deep code review with web research to verify against latest ecosystem:

- Check library versions
- Verify security patterns
- Review against official docs

### safeword-refactoring

Systematic refactoring with small-step discipline:

- One change → test → commit cycle
- For structural improvements only
- NOT for adding features or fixing bugs

### safeword-writing-plans

Creates execution plans with:

- Exact file paths
- Complete code examples
- Verification steps

## Using Skills

Invoke skills with slash commands in Claude Code:

```text
/safeword-debugging
```

Or mention the trigger phrase in your prompt:

```text
"Debug this test failure..."
```

## IDE Parity

Skills are installed for both Claude Code and Cursor:

| IDE         | Location                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/safeword-*/`   |
| Cursor      | `.cursor/rules/safeword-*.mdc` |
