Structured workflows that guide AI agents through tasks with discipline and best practices. Skills activate automatically based on task context.

## safeword-brainstorming

Use before implementation when refining rough ideas into specs. Guides through Socratic questioning, alternative exploration, and incremental validation.

## safeword-debugging

Four-phase framework: **Investigate** → **Hypothesize** → **Test** → **Fix**. Ensures root cause identification before applying solutions.

## safeword-tdd-enforcing

Strict test discipline: **RED** (write failing test) → **GREEN** (minimum code to pass) → **REFACTOR** (improve while tests pass).

## safeword-quality-reviewer

Deep review with web research. Checks library versions, security patterns, and best practices against official docs.

## safeword-refactoring

One change → test → commit cycle. For structural improvements only—not for adding features or fixing bugs.

## safeword-writing-plans

Creates execution plans with exact file paths, complete code examples, and verification steps.
