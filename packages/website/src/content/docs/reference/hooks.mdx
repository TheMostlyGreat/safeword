Hooks run automatically at key moments during your coding session. You don't invoke them—they work in the background.

    ### What runs automatically

    | When                    | What happens                                          |
    | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | Session starts          | Verifies AGENTS.md link, shows version, checks lint   |
    | You submit a prompt     | Adds timestamp, reminds agent to ask questions        |
    | Agent edits a file      | Runs the appropriate linter                           |
    | You stop the session    | Prompts for quality review                            |

    ### Auto-linting

    After your agent writes or modifies a file, the right linter runs:

    | File type               | Linter        |
    | ----------------------- | ------------- |
    | TypeScript / JavaScript | ESLint        |
    | Python                  | Ruff          |
    | Go                      | golangci-lint |

    If a linter isn't installed, it's silently skipped.

    **What you see:** `SAFEWORD: Linting...` appears in output. If there are issues, your agent sees them and fixes immediately.

    ### Customizing hooks

    Default hooks get overwritten on `safeword upgrade`. To customize:

    1. Copy the hook to `.safeword-project/` (e.g., `my-lint.ts`)
    2. Update `.claude/settings.json` to point to your copy
    3. Your custom hook stays safe from upgrades

    Hook config: `.claude/settings.json`
    Hook files: `.safeword/hooks/`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cursor">
    Safeword installs hooks (`.cursor/hooks.json`) and rules (`.cursor/rules/`) to guide your agent's behavior.

    ### What runs automatically

    | When                    | What happens                                          |
    | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | Agent edits a file      | Runs the appropriate linter                           |
    | You stop the session    | Prompts for quality review                            |

    ### Auto-linting

    After your agent writes or modifies a file, the right linter runs:

    | File type               | Linter        |
    | ----------------------- | ------------- |
    | TypeScript / JavaScript | ESLint        |
    | Python                  | Ruff          |
    | Go                      | golangci-lint |

    If a linter isn't installed, it's silently skipped.

    **What you see:** `SAFEWORD: Linting...` appears in output. If there are issues, your agent sees them and fixes immediately.

    ### What rules provide

    Rules shape agent behavior through system prompts:

    | Rule              | What it does                                         |
    | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
    | Debugging         | Investigate before jumping to fixes                  |
    | TDD               | Write tests first, then implementation               |
    | Refactoring       | One small change at a time, test after each          |
    | Brainstorming     | Ask clarifying questions before proposing solutions  |
    | Quality Reviewing | Check against current docs and best practices        |

    ### Customizing hooks and rules

    Default hooks and rules get overwritten on `safeword upgrade`. To customize:

    1. Copy the file to `.safeword-project/`
    2. For rules: reference your copy in your workflow
    3. For hooks: update `.cursor/hooks.json` to point to your copy

    Hook config: `.cursor/hooks.json`
    Rule files: `.cursor/rules/`
