import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Automation and guardrails that guide your coding session.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Claude Code">
    TypeScript scripts executed with Bun at specific trigger points.

    | Hook                       | Trigger          | Purpose                           |
    | -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | `session-version.ts`       | SessionStart     | Display safeword version          |
    | `session-verify-agents.ts` | SessionStart     | Verify AGENTS.md link exists      |
    | `session-lint-check.ts`    | SessionStart     | Check for lint errors             |
    | `prompt-timestamp.ts`      | UserPromptSubmit | Inject timestamp into prompts     |
    | `prompt-questions.ts`      | UserPromptSubmit | Remind agent to ask questions     |
    | `post-tool-lint.ts`        | PostToolUse      | Auto-lint after file edits        |
    | `stop-quality.ts`          | Stop             | Prompt for quality review on stop |

    ### Auto-Linting

    The `post-tool-lint.ts` hook routes files to the correct linter:

    | Extension         | Linter        |
    | ----------------- | ------------- |
    | `.js`, `.ts`, etc | ESLint        |
    | `.py`, `.pyi`     | Ruff          |
    | `.go`             | golangci-lint |

    Linters run silently if not installed.

    ### Custom Hooks

    Hooks are "owned" files—overwritten on `safeword upgrade`. To customize:

    1. Copy the hook to a new name (e.g., `my-lint.ts`)
    2. Update `.claude/settings.json` to use your hook
    3. Your custom hook won't be touched by upgrades

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cursor">
    Cursor uses **rules files** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) rather than event-driven hooks.

    Safeword installs rules that provide similar guidance:

    | Rule                           | Purpose                                   |
    | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
    | `safeword-debugging.mdc`       | Four-phase debugging discipline           |
    | `safeword-tdd-enforcing.mdc`   | RED → GREEN → REFACTOR enforcement        |
    | `safeword-refactoring.mdc`     | Small-step refactoring with tests         |
    | `safeword-brainstorming.mdc`   | Collaborative design through questioning  |
    | `safeword-quality-reviewer.mdc`| Deep code review guidance                 |

    ### Differences from Claude Code

    - **No event triggers** — Rules are persistent instructions, not event-driven
    - **No auto-linting** — Run `/lint` manually or configure Cursor's format-on-save
    - **No session hooks** — Rules apply continuously during the session

    ### Custom Rules

    Rules are "owned" files—overwritten on `safeword upgrade`. To customize:

    1. Copy the rule to a new name (e.g., `my-debugging.mdc`)
    2. Modify as needed
    3. Your custom rule won't be touched by upgrades
