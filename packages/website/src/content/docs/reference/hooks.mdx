Hooks are automatic actions that run at key moments during your coding session. You don't invoke them—they just work in the background.

    ### What runs automatically

    | When                         | What happens                              |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
    | Session starts               | Shows Safeword version, checks for lint errors |
    | You submit a prompt          | Adds timestamp, reminds agent to ask clarifying questions |
    | Agent edits a file           | Runs the appropriate linter automatically |
    | You stop the session         | Prompts for a quality review              |

    ### Auto-linting

    After your agent writes or modifies a file, the right linter runs automatically:

    | File type                | Linter        |
    | ------------------------ | ------------- |
    | TypeScript / JavaScript  | ESLint        |
    | Python                   | Ruff          |
    | Go                       | golangci-lint |

    If a linter isn't installed, it's silently skipped.

    **What you see:** When linting runs, you'll see `SAFEWORD: Linting...` in the output. If there are issues, your agent sees them and can fix them immediately.

    ### Customizing hooks

    The default hooks get overwritten when you run `safeword upgrade`. To customize:

    1. Copy the hook to a new name (e.g., `my-lint.ts`)
    2. Update `.claude/settings.json` to point to your hook
    3. Your custom hook won't be touched by upgrades

    Hook files live in `.safeword/hooks/`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cursor">
    Cursor now supports hooks via `.cursor/hooks.json`. Safeword installs both hooks and **rules** (`.cursor/rules/`) to guide your agent's behavior.

    ### What runs automatically

    | When                         | What happens                              |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
    | Agent edits a file           | Runs the appropriate linter automatically |
    | You stop the session         | Prompts for a quality review              |

    ### What rules provide

    | Rule              | What it does                                       |
    | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | Debugging         | Makes your agent investigate before jumping to fixes |
    | TDD               | Enforces write-test-first discipline               |
    | Refactoring       | One small change at a time, test after each        |
    | Brainstorming     | Asks clarifying questions before proposing solutions |
    | Quality Reviewing | Checks against current docs and best practices     |

    ### Customizing rules

    Default rules get overwritten on `safeword upgrade`. To customize:

    1. Copy the rule to a new name (e.g., `my-debugging.mdc`)
    2. Modify as needed
    3. Your custom rule won't be touched by upgrades

    Rule files live in `.cursor/rules/`. Hook config is in `.cursor/hooks.json`.
