Slash commands are quick actions you can type in Claude Code. Just type the command and hit enter.

| Command            | What it does                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/lint`            | Fix code style issues                                  |
| `/audit`           | Find dead code and architecture drift                  |
| `/drift`           | Sync docs with actual code structure                   |
| `/quality-review`  | Deep review against latest best practices              |
| `/cleanup-zombies` | Kill stuck processes hogging ports                     |
| `/tdd`             | Start test-driven development workflow                 |
| `/bdd`             | Start behavior-driven development for complex features |
| `/refactor`        | Start safe refactoring workflow                        |

## /lint

Runs the right linter for each file type:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript** — ESLint + Prettier
- **Python** — Ruff + mypy
- **Go** — golangci-lint

**When to use:** After writing code, before committing, or when you see style warnings.

---

## /audit

Scans your codebase for:

- Dead code (unused exports, unreachable functions)
- Circular dependencies
- Files that don't match your architecture patterns

**When to use:** During refactoring, before a big PR, or when the codebase feels messy.

---

## /drift

Compares your `ARCHITECTURE.md` against your actual file structure. Creates the doc if it doesn't exist.

**When to use:** When onboarding new devs, after major refactors, or when docs feel stale.

---

## /quality-review

Reviews your recent changes against:

- Official library documentation
- Current security best practices
- Latest package versions

Uses web search to verify against up-to-date sources.

**When to use:** Before merging important features, when using unfamiliar libraries, or for security-sensitive code.

---

## /cleanup-zombies

Finds and kills:

- Dev servers that didn't shut down cleanly
- Test runners stuck in watch mode
- Processes blocking ports you need

**When to use:** When `port 3000 is already in use` or your machine feels sluggish.

---

## /tdd

Starts a test-driven development session. Your agent will:

1. Define scope before coding
2. Write a failing test first (RED)
3. Write minimum code to pass (GREEN)
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

**When to use:** When implementing new features or fixing bugs where you want test coverage.

---

## /bdd

Starts behavior-driven development for complex features. Your agent will:

1. Discover requirements through conversation
2. Define scenarios with Given/When/Then
3. Break into implementable tasks
4. Implement each task using TDD

**When to use:** For features spanning multiple files or requiring coordination across components.

---

## /refactor

Starts safe refactoring with small steps. Your agent will:

1. Make one small change
2. Run tests to verify
3. Commit if green
4. Repeat

**When to use:** When cleaning up code, extracting functions, or improving structure.
