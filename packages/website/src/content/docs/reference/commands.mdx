# Commands

Commands are slash commands available in Claude Code. They provide quick access to common tasks.

## Available Commands

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/lint`            | Run linters and formatters                |
| `/audit`           | Run architecture and dead code analysis   |
| `/drift`           | Check if architecture docs match codebase |
| `/quality-review`  | Deep code review with web research        |
| `/cleanup-zombies` | Kill zombie dev server processes          |

## Command Details

### /lint

Run linters and formatters to fix code style issues.

```text
/lint
```

Runs the appropriate linter based on file type:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Python**: Ruff (fast linting) + mypy (type checking)
- **Go**: golangci-lint

### /audit

Run comprehensive code audit for architecture and dead code.

```text
/audit
```

Analyzes:

- Architecture compliance
- Dead code detection
- Dependency analysis

### /drift

Check if architecture documentation matches the actual codebase.

```text
/drift
```

Compares:

- ARCHITECTURE.md against actual structure
- Documented patterns against implementation
- Creates or updates docs if missing

### /quality-review

Deep code review with web research to verify against latest ecosystem.

```text
/quality-review
```

Checks:

- Library versions against latest
- Security patterns
- Best practices from official docs

### /cleanup-zombies

Kill zombie dev servers and test processes for the project.

```text
/cleanup-zombies
```

Cleans up:

- Orphaned dev server processes
- Stuck test runners
- Port conflicts

## Command Location

Commands live in `.claude/commands/`:

```text

├── audit.md
├── cleanup-zombies.md
├── drift.md
├── lint.md
└── quality-review.md
```

## Using Commands

In Claude Code, type the command with a slash:

```text
/lint
```

Commands are different from skills - they're quick actions rather than structured workflows.
