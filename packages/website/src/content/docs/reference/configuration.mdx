Most projects work great with the defaults. This page covers customization when you need it.

## ESLint Setup

Safeword includes an ESLint plugin with sensible defaults. Your `eslint.config.mjs`:

```js
import safeword from 'eslint-plugin-safeword';

export default [
  ...safeword.configs.recommendedTypeScript,
  ...safeword.configs.react, // if using React
  ...safeword.configs.vitest, // if using Vitest
];
```

**Available configs:** `recommendedTypeScript`, `react`, `vitest`, `playwright`, `astro`

To add your own rules, extend the array:

```js
export default [
  ...safeword.configs.recommendedTypeScript,
  {
    rules: {
      'no-console': 'warn',
    },
  },
];
```

## Language Detection

Safeword auto-detects your stack and configures linting accordingly:

| Language   | Linting           | Type Checking |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| TypeScript | ESLint + Prettier | tsc           |
| Python     | Ruff              | mypy          |
| Go         | golangci-lint     | go vet        |

Detection is stored in `.safeword/config.json`. To force a refresh, delete that file and run `safeword setup` again.

## Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json`. See [Hooks reference](/reference/hooks) for what runs automatically.

To disable a specific hook, remove it from the `hooks` array in settings.

## Customizing Without Losing Upgrades

Safeword has two types of files:

**Overwritten on upgrade** (you shouldn't edit these directly):

- `.safeword/hooks/*`, `.safeword/guides/*`, `.safeword/templates/*`
- `.claude/skills/*`, `.claude/commands/*`
- `.cursor/rules/*`

**Never overwritten** (safe to customize):

- `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `AGENTS.md`

**To customize something that gets overwritten:**

1. Copy it to `.safeword-project/` (e.g., `.safeword-project/my-hook.ts`)
2. Update `.claude/settings.json` to point to your copy
3. Your version won't be touched by upgrades

## Project-Specific Content

Put custom content in `.safeword-project/`:

- Custom hooks
- Project-specific guides
- Team conventions

This folder is yours—Safeword will never modify it.
