Most projects work great with the defaults. This page covers customization when you need it.

## ESLint Setup

Safeword includes an ESLint plugin with sensible defaults. Your `eslint.config.mjs`:

```js
import safeword from 'safeword/eslint';

export default [
  ...safeword.configs.recommendedTypeScript,
  ...safeword.configs.vitest, // if using Vitest
];
```

**Available configs:**

| Config                       | Use case               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `recommended`                | JavaScript only        |
| `recommendedTypeScript`      | TypeScript             |
| `recommendedTypeScriptReact` | TypeScript + React     |
| `recommendedTypeScriptNext`  | TypeScript + Next.js   |
| `vitest`                     | Add Vitest support     |
| `playwright`                 | Add Playwright support |
| `astro`                      | Add Astro support      |
| `tailwind`                   | Add Tailwind support   |
| `tanstackQuery`              | Add TanStack Query     |

To add your own rules, extend the array:

```js
export default [
  ...safeword.configs.recommendedTypeScript,
  {
    rules: {
      'no-console': 'warn',
    },
  },
];
```

## Language Detection

Safeword auto-detects your stack and configures linting accordingly:

| Language   | Linting           | Type Checking |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| TypeScript | ESLint + Prettier | tsc           |
| Python     | Ruff              | mypy          |
| Go         | golangci-lint     | go vet        |

Detection is stored in `.safeword/config.json`. To force a refresh, delete that file and run `safeword setup` again.

## Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json`. See [Hooks & Skills](/reference/hooks-and-skills) for what runs automatically.

To disable a specific hook, remove it from the `hooks` array in settings.

## Customizing Without Losing Upgrades

Safeword has two types of files:

**Overwritten on upgrade** (you shouldn't edit these directly):

- `.safeword/hooks/*`, `.safeword/guides/*`, `.safeword/templates/*`
- `.claude/skills/*`, `.claude/commands/*`
- `.cursor/rules/*`

**Never overwritten** (safe to customize):

- `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `AGENTS.md`

**To customize something that gets overwritten:**

1. Copy it to `.safeword-project/` (e.g., `.safeword-project/my-hook.ts`)
2. Update `.claude/settings.json` to point to your copy
3. Your version won't be touched by upgrades

## Project-Specific Content

Put custom content in `.safeword-project/`:

- Custom hooks
- Project-specific guides
- Team conventions

This folder is yours—Safeword will never modify it.
