All commands run via `bunx safeword@latest` (or just `bunx safeword` if you have it installed locally).

## safeword setup

Initialize Safeword in a project. Run this once when you first add Safeword to a repo.

```bash
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

| Option        | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip confirmation prompts |

**When to use:** First time setting up Safeword in a project, or after cloning a repo that doesn't have Safeword yet.

### What gets installed

| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `.safeword/`            | Creates directory   | Hooks, guides, templates |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Creates file        | Hook configuration       |
| `.claude/skills/`       | Creates directory   | Workflow skills          |
| `.cursor/hooks.json`    | Creates file        | Hook configuration       |
| `.cursor/rules/`        | Creates directory   | Behavior rules           |
| `eslint.config.mjs`     | Creates file        | Linting config (JS/TS)   |

| `.golangci.yml`         | Creates file        | Linting config (Go)      |
| `AGENTS.md`             | Creates or prepends | Links to SAFEWORD.md     |
| `.mcp.json`             | Creates or merges   | MCP server config        |

Setup auto-detects your stack. A TypeScript project won't get Go or Python tooling.

## safeword upgrade

Update Safeword files to the latest version.

```bash
bunx safeword@latest upgrade
```

**When to use:** After a new Safeword release, or when you want the latest improvements. Your customizations to skills and hooks are preserved—only the core files get updated.

## safeword check

Verify your installation and report issues.

```bash
bunx safeword@latest check
```

| Option      | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `--offline` | Skip remote version check |

**When to use:** If something seems broken, or to verify everything is set up correctly. Shows missing files, version info, and potential problems.

## safeword reset

Remove all Safeword files from your project.

```bash
bunx safeword reset
```

| Option        | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip confirmation                     |
| `--full`      | Also remove linting config + packages |

**When to use:** If you want to uninstall Safeword completely. The `--full` flag also removes the linting setup (ESLint config, packages in package.json).

## safeword diff

Show differences between your local files and the latest templates.

```bash
bunx safeword@latest diff
```

| Option | Description           |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| `-v`   | Show full diff output |

**When to use:** Before upgrading, to see what would change. Or to check if you've customized any files.

---

## File Ownership

Safeword manages two types of files:

**Owned files** — Safeword controls these completely. They get overwritten on upgrade. Examples: core hooks, lint scripts.

**Managed files** — You can customize these. Safeword won't overwrite your changes during upgrade. Examples: skills, custom hooks you've added.

Run `safeword diff` to see which files you've modified.
