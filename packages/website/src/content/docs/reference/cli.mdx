## How Guide Imports Work

`AGENTS.md` contains a link: `@./.safeword/SAFEWORD.md` (also added to `CLAUDE.md` if present)

SAFEWORD.md then imports guides via the Quick Reference table. Claude Code auto-loads these as context.

## Learnings System

Check for existing learnings:

```bash
ls .safeword/learnings/
```

Extract new learning:

1. Follow recognition triggers in `learning-extraction.md`
2. Create `.safeword/learnings/[concept].md`
3. Use template: Problem → Gotcha → Examples → Testing Trap
