**The first agent discipline system.**

---

## The Problem

Your agent ships fast. But it skips tests, ignores lint, and pushes whatever "looks right."

Your seniors stop trusting it. Your vibe-coders can't tell working code from confident garbage.

AI doesn't decide when it's done. You do.

---

## The Fix

**Automatic Enforcement** — Every edit gets linted. Every session ends with review. Your agent can't skip it.

**Strict Quality** — Code, architecture, docs, dependencies. Nothing slips through.

**Structured Discipline** — TDD enforced. Debugging structured. Refactoring gated.

---

## Install

```bash
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

Works with **Claude Code** and **Cursor**. Auto-detects **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Go**.

---

## What Happens

Safeword installs hooks and skills that activate automatically. Commits to your repo—team gets discipline the moment they pull.

---

## Stay Current

```bash
bunx safeword@latest upgrade
```
