---

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun** (runtime)
- A project with one or more of:
  - `package.json` (JavaScript/TypeScript)
  - `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` (Python)
  - `go.mod` (Go)

## Quick Setup

```bash
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npx safeword@latest setup
```

Use `-y` flag for non-interactive mode:

```bash
bunx safeword@latest setup -y
```

## What Gets Installed

The setup command creates:

| Path                | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.safeword/`        | Hooks, guides, and templates                   |
| `.claude/`          | Claude Code settings and skills                |
| `.cursor/rules/`    | Cursor AI rules                                |
| `eslint.config.mjs` | ESLint with safeword plugin                    |
| `.prettierrc`       | Prettier configuration                         |
| `AGENTS.md`         | Project context (patches CLAUDE.md if present) |
| `.mcp.json`         | MCP server configuration                       |

## Language-Specific Setup

Safeword auto-detects project languages and installs appropriate tooling:

| Language   | Detection        | Linting                    |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| TypeScript | `package.json`   | ESLint + Prettier          |
| Python     | `pyproject.toml` | Ruff (fast) + mypy (types) |
| Go         | `go.mod`         | golangci-lint              |

## Auto-Detection

The setup command detects frameworks from `package.json` and installs relevant ESLint/Prettier plugins:

- TypeScript, React, Next.js, Astro, Vue, Svelte, Electron
- Vitest, Playwright, Tailwind
- Publishable libraries (adds publint)

## Verify Installation

```bash
# Check for SAFEWORD files and hooks
test -f .safeword/SAFEWORD.md && echo ".safeword/SAFEWORD.md ✓"
test -f .claude/settings.json && echo ".claude/settings.json ✓"
```

Or run the check command:

```bash
bunx safeword@latest check
```

## Upgrading

```bash
bunx safeword@latest upgrade
```

This updates owned files while preserving your customizations to managed files.

Preview changes before upgrading:

```bash
bunx safeword@latest diff
bunx safeword@latest diff -v # Full diff output
```

## Syncing Across Machines

Commit `.safeword/` and `.claude/` in your project repo for team consistency.
