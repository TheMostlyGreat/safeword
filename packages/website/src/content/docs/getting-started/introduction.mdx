# Safeword

**AI coding agent guardrails** - hooks, skills, and quality controls for Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding assistants.

## Why Safeword?

AI coding agents are powerful but need guidance:

- **Hooks** - Auto-lint on file changes, quality review on session end
- **Skills** - Structured workflows for TDD, debugging, refactoring
- **ESLint Plugin** - Catch common LLM mistakes (incomplete error handling, etc.)

## Quick Install

```bash
npx safeword setup
```

This sets up:

- `.safeword/` directory with hooks and guides
- `.claude/` or `.cursor/` configuration
- ESLint + Prettier with LLM-optimized rules
