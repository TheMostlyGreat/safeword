# Safeword

**Problem**: AI agents write code without tests, skip design validation, and lack consistency across projects.

**Solution**: Portable patterns and guides that enforce TDD workflow, quality standards, and best practices across all your projects.

## Why Safeword?

AI coding agents are powerful but need guidance:

- **Hooks** - Auto-lint on file changes, quality review on session end, version tracking
- **Skills** - Structured workflows for TDD, debugging, refactoring, brainstorming
- **Commands** - Slash commands for linting, auditing, drift detection
- **Guides** - TDD methodology, testing, planning, code philosophy
- **ESLint Plugin** - Catch common LLM mistakes (incomplete error handling, etc.)
- **Multi-language** - JavaScript/TypeScript, Python (Ruff), Go (golangci-lint)

## Quick Install

```bash
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

This sets up:

| Path                | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `.safeword/`        | Hooks, guides, and templates    |
| `.claude/`          | Claude Code settings and skills |
| `.cursor/rules/`    | Cursor AI rules                 |
| `eslint.config.mjs` | ESLint with safeword plugin     |
| `.prettierrc`       | Prettier configuration          |
| `AGENTS.md`         | Project context with framework  |

## How It Works

**Project-local framework**: Scripts write to `.safeword/` and `.claude/` in your project (no global install needed)

**Team consistency**: Teammates get the framework from your project repo

**Living documentation**: Update guides as you learn, extract learnings from debugging, archive completed work

## What's Inside

- `.safeword/guides/` - Core methodology and best practices
- `.safeword/templates/` - Fillable document structures
- `.safeword/planning/` - Specs, test definitions, design docs
- `.safeword/hooks/` - Automation scripts for Claude Code
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands
- `.claude/skills/` - Specialized agent capabilities

## MCP Server Integrations

Safeword auto-configures these MCP servers:

- **context7** - Up-to-date library documentation lookup
- **playwright** - Browser automation for testing
