# Quick Start

## 1. Install

```bash
npx safeword setup --yes
```

## 2. Start Coding

Open your project in Claude Code or Cursor. Safeword hooks activate automatically:

- **On file edit** → ESLint runs on changed files
- **On prompt submit** → Questions are detected for clarification
- **On session end** → Quality review suggests improvements

## 3. Use Skills

Invoke skills with slash commands:

```
/safeword-debugging     # Structured debugging workflow
/safeword-enforcing-tdd # RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
/safeword-refactoring   # Safe refactoring with tests
```

## 4. Check Status

```bash
npx safeword check
```

Verifies your setup is correct and reports any issues.
