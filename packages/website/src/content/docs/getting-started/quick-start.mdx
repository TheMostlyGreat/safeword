title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with Safeword in 30 seconds
---

# Quick Start

## 1. Install (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

## 2. Verify

```bash
# Check for SAFEWORD files and hooks
test -f .safeword/SAFEWORD.md && echo ".safeword/SAFEWORD.md ✓"
test -f .claude/settings.json && echo ".claude/settings.json ✓"
```

**Result**: Your project now has:

- `.safeword/SAFEWORD.md` - Global patterns and workflows
- `.safeword/guides/` - TDD methodology, testing, code philosophy
- `.safeword/hooks/` - Claude Code hooks (auto-linting, quality review)
- `.claude/settings.json` - Hook configuration for Claude Code
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands (`/lint`, `/quality-review`, `/drift`)
- `AGENTS.md` - Project context with framework reference

**Commit these to your repo** for team consistency.

## 3. Start Coding

Open your project in Claude Code or Cursor. Safeword hooks activate automatically:

- **On session start** → Version check, lint check, AGENTS.md verification
- **On prompt submit** → Timestamp injection, question reminders
- **On file edit** → Auto-lint changed files (ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint)
- **On session end** → Quality review prompt

## 4. Use Commands

Invoke commands with slash syntax:

```text
/lint              # Run linters and formatters
/audit             # Run architecture and dead code analysis
/drift             # Check if docs match reality
/quality-review    # Deep code review with web research
/cleanup-zombies   # Kill zombie dev server processes
```

## 5. Use Skills

Skills are structured workflows that guide the AI:

```text
/safeword-debugging      # Four-phase debugging (investigate first)
/safeword-enforcing-tdd  # RED → GREEN → REFACTOR discipline
/safeword-refactoring    # Small-step refactoring with tests
/safeword-brainstorming  # Collaborative design through questioning
/safeword-writing-plans  # Create detailed execution plans
```

## 6. Check Status

```bash
bunx safeword@latest check
bunx safeword@latest check --offline # Skip remote version check
```

Verifies your setup and reports any issues.
