import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

One command. Your agent writes better code.

## Install

```bash
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

Takes about 30 seconds. Works with TypeScript, Python, and Go projects.

## What Changes

You use Claude Code or Cursor the same way you always have. Type a prompt, get code. But now there's a safety net running in the background.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Claude Code">
    **Every edit gets linted automatically.** After your agent writes or modifies a file, Safeword runs your linter. If there are issues, your agent sees them immediately and fixes them—before you even notice.

    **Every session ends with a quality check.** When you're done working, Safeword prompts your agent to review what it built. Catches things like missing error handling, security issues, or code that doesn't match the codebase style.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cursor">
    **Your agent follows structured workflows.** Safeword adds rules that guide how your agent approaches tasks. When debugging, it investigates before jumping to fixes. When building features, it writes tests first.

    **Same prompts, better results.** You don't change how you work. The rules run in the background, steering your agent toward code that actually works.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Try It

Open your project and ask your agent to do something it would normally rush through:

> "Add a function that validates an email address"

Watch what happens. The agent writes the code, but now:

1. Lint runs automatically (Claude Code) or rules guide the approach (Cursor)
2. If there are issues, they get caught and fixed
3. You get cleaner code on the first try

## What Got Installed

Safeword added a few folders to your project:

| Folder            | What's in it                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/hooks/`  | Scripts that run automatically (lint, quality checks) |
| `.claude/skills/` | Structured workflows for debugging, TDD, refactoring  |
| `.safeword/`      | Config files and guides                               |
| `.cursor/rules/`  | Rules for Cursor (if detected)                        |

These files commit to your repo. When your team pulls, they get the same setup automatically.

## Go Deeper

Most developers stop here. The defaults work well and you don't need to configure anything.

When you're ready to understand what's happening under the hood:

- [Hooks](/reference/hooks) — The automatic checks that run on every edit
- [Skills](/reference/skills) — Structured workflows like debugging and TDD
- [Commands](/reference/commands) — Slash commands like `/commit` and `/lint`
- [Configuration](/reference/configuration) — Customize what gets enforced

## Staying Current

Safeword improves over time. Update when you want the latest:

```bash
bunx safeword@latest upgrade
```

Your customizations are preserved. Only the core files get updated.
