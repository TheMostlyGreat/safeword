import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

One command. Your agent writes better code.

## Install

```bash
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

Takes about 30 seconds. Works with TypeScript, Python, and Go projects.

## What Changes

You use Claude Code or Cursor the same way you always have. Type a prompt, get code. But now there's a safety net running in the background.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Claude Code">
    **Every edit gets linted automatically.** After your agent writes or modifies a file, Safeword runs your linter. If there are issues, your agent sees them immediately and fixes them—before you even notice.

    **Every session ends with a quality check.** When you're done working, Safeword prompts your agent to review what it built. Catches things like missing error handling, security issues, or code that doesn't match the codebase style.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cursor">
    **Your agent follows structured workflows.** Safeword adds rules (`.cursor/rules/`) that guide how your agent approaches tasks. When debugging, it investigates before jumping to fixes. When building features, it follows your codebase patterns.

    **Better decisions, automatically.** The rules kick in based on what you're asking for—no special commands needed.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Try It

Open your project and ask your agent to build something real:

> "Add an API endpoint that returns user profile data"

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Claude Code">
    Watch what happens:

    1. Your agent writes the endpoint
    2. Lint runs automatically — you'll see `SAFEWORD: Linting...` in the output
    3. If there are issues, your agent fixes them before you even see the code
    4. When you stop the session, a quality review runs automatically

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cursor">
    Watch what happens:

    1. Your agent investigates your existing API patterns first
    2. It follows the structure of your codebase
    3. If you ask it to debug something, it'll investigate before jumping to fixes

    The rules in `.cursor/rules/` guide this behavior automatically.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## What Got Installed

Safeword added a few folders to your project:

| Folder              | What's in it                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `.safeword/hooks/`  | Scripts that run automatically (lint, quality checks) |
| `.claude/skills/`   | Structured workflows for debugging, TDD, refactoring  |
| `.claude/commands/` | Slash commands like `/lint` and `/audit`              |
| `.safeword/`        | Config files, guides, and ESLint setup                |
| `.cursor/rules/`    | Rules for Cursor (if detected)                        |

These files commit to your repo. When your team pulls, they get the same setup automatically.

## Go Deeper

Most developers stop here. The defaults work well and you don't need to configure anything.

When you're ready to understand what's happening under the hood:

- [Hooks & Skills](/reference/hooks-and-skills) — Automatic checks, slash commands, and structured workflows
- [Configuration](/reference/configuration) — Customize what gets enforced

## Staying Current

Safeword improves over time. Update when you want the latest:

```bash
bunx safeword@latest upgrade
```

Your customizations are preserved. Only the core files get updated.
