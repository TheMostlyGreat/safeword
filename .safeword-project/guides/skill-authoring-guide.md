# Skill Authoring Guide

How to write Claude Skills that are discoverable, effective, and production-ready.

## Skill Structure

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md        # Required. Main instructions (<500 lines)
├── REFERENCE.md    # Optional. API details, loaded on demand
├── EXAMPLES.md     # Optional. Usage patterns, loaded on demand
└── scripts/        # Optional. Utility scripts
    └── helper.py
```

**How loading works:**

1. **Startup:** Only `name` and `description` from frontmatter are loaded (~100 tokens)
2. **Activation:** Full SKILL.md loads when skill is triggered (<5k tokens ideal)
3. **On-demand:** Referenced files load only when Claude needs them

---

## Naming

Use **gerund form** (verb + -ing). This clearly describes the activity.

| Form       | Examples                                      | Status     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Gerund     | `brainstorming`, `debugging`, `tdd-enforcing` | Preferred  |
| Noun-agent | `debugger`, `tdd-enforcer`                    | Acceptable |
| Vague      | `helper`, `utils`, `tools`                    | Avoid      |

**Keyword-first pattern:** For methodology skills (BDD, TDD), put the keyword first for searchability: `bdd-orchestrating`, `tdd-enforcing`. Users searching "bdd" or "tdd" find them faster.

**Official Claude Code requirements:**

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Max 64 characters
- Directory name must match `name` field in SKILL.md frontmatter
- No reserved words: `anthropic`, `claude`

**Precedence:** If two skills share a name, higher scope wins: managed → personal → project → plugin.

## Description (Critical for Selection Accuracy)

The description is the **primary signal** for skill discovery. Claude uses pure LLM reasoning—no embeddings, classifiers, or pattern matching—to select skills based solely on description text.

**How selection works:**

1. At startup, all skill descriptions load into system prompt (~100 tokens each)
2. Claude reads descriptions and matches user intent using language understanding
3. Best-matching skill is selected and its full SKILL.md loads

**This means:** Description quality directly determines auto-invocation accuracy.

### Requirements

- Write in **third person** (injected into system prompt; first/second person causes issues)
- Include **what it does** AND **when to use it**
- Include **trigger phrases** users would actually say
- Max 1024 characters

### The WHEN + WHEN NOT Pattern

Generic descriptions fail. Specific boundaries succeed. Testing shows ~20% activation with generic descriptions vs 80%+ with the WHEN + WHEN NOT pattern.

```yaml
# BAD - Too vague, will misfire
description: Helps with code quality

# BAD - Missing triggers
description: Performs deep code review with web research

# GOOD - Specific triggers + boundaries
description: Deep code quality review with web research. Use when user
  requests verification against latest docs ('double check against latest',
  'verify versions', 'check security'), needs analysis beyond automatic
  hook, or works on projects without SAFEWORD.md. Do NOT use for quick
  fixes or when user just wants code written.
```

### Effective Description Anatomy

```yaml
description: [WHAT it does]. [WHEN to use - specific triggers].
  [WHEN NOT to use - prevents misfires].
```

**Examples from official docs:**

```yaml
# PDF Processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge
  documents. Use when working with PDF files or when user mentions PDFs,
  forms, or document extraction.

# Git Commit Helper
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs.
  Use when user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged
  changes.

# Stakeholder Context (with WHEN NOT)
description: Stakeholder context for Test Project when discussing product
  features, UX research, or stakeholder interviews. Auto-invoke when user
  mentions Test Project, product lead, or UX research. Do NOT load for
  general stakeholder discussions unrelated to Test Project.
```

### Keywords Matter

Include terms users would actually say:

- File extensions: `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`
- Action words: "debug", "review", "verify", "check"
- Domain terms: "commit message", "test failure", "latest docs"
- Quoted phrases: `'double check'`, `'not working'`

### Testing Selection Accuracy

1. Try invoking with various phrasings - does the right skill activate?
2. Try similar requests - does it avoid misfiring on wrong skills?
3. Test with Haiku (needs more guidance) and Opus (avoid over-triggering)

## SKILL.md Body

### Size Limits

- Keep under **500 lines** for optimal performance
- If larger, split into referenced files

### Progressive Disclosure

Show just enough to help Claude decide what to do next. Reference details.

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick Start

[Essential instructions here]

## Advanced Features

See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for form filling
See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for API details
```

**Key rules:**

- References **one level deep only** (no nested references)
- Long reference files need **table of contents** at top
- Use **forward slashes** in paths (`reference/guide.md`, not `reference\guide.md`)

### Conciseness

Claude is already smart. Only add context it doesn't have.

```markdown
# BAD - Over-explaining (~150 tokens)

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that
contains text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF,
you'll need to use a library. There are many libraries available...

# GOOD - Concise (~50 tokens)

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
\`\`\`python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
\`\`\`
```

## Workflows

For complex tasks, provide checklists Claude can track.

```markdown
## Form Filling Workflow

Copy this checklist:

- [ ] Step 1: Analyze form (run analyze_form.py)
- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping
- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping
- [ ] Step 4: Fill form
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output

**Step 1: Analyze form**
Run: `python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf`
...
```

### Feedback Loops

For quality-critical operations, include validation steps:

```markdown
1. Make edits
2. **Validate immediately**: `python scripts/validate.py`
3. If validation fails → fix and validate again
4. **Only proceed when validation passes**
```

## Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to task fragility:

| Freedom | When                      | Example                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| High    | Multiple valid approaches | "Analyze code structure and suggest improvements" |
| Medium  | Preferred pattern exists  | Template with customization options               |
| Low     | Operations are fragile    | "Run exactly this script. Do not modify."         |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't                     | Do                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Windows paths (`\`)       | Forward slashes (`/`)                     |
| Offer too many options    | Provide default with escape hatch         |
| Assume packages installed | List dependencies explicitly              |
| Deeply nested references  | One level deep from SKILL.md              |
| Time-sensitive info       | Use "old patterns" section for deprecated |
| Inconsistent terminology  | Pick one term, use throughout             |

---

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing a skill:

- [ ] Name uses gerund form
- [ ] Description includes what + when (third person)
- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines
- [ ] References one level deep
- [ ] No time-sensitive information
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Concrete examples provided
- [ ] Tested with Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus

---

## Schema Registration (CRITICAL)

**Every new template file MUST be registered in `packages/cli/src/schema.ts`.**

Without schema registration, templates are orphaned and never installed by `safeword setup` or `safeword upgrade`.

**For new skills:**

1. Add to `ownedFiles`:
   - `.claude/skills/safeword-{name}/SKILL.md` → `skills/safeword-{name}/SKILL.md`
   - `.cursor/rules/safeword-{name}.mdc` → `cursor/rules/safeword-{name}.mdc`

2. For new commands:
   - `.claude/commands/{name}.md` → `commands/{name}.md`
   - `.cursor/commands/{name}.md` → `commands/{name}.md`

See [Schema Registration Guide](./../guides/schema-registration-guide.md) for the full list of template types and their schema mappings.
