# Stateful BDD Flow

**Goal:** Agent knows where it is in BDD workflow and acts accordingly.

**Why:** Enforce behavior-first development with proper phase gates and outside-in TDD.

## Snowflake Implementation Order

| Iter | Stories         | Capability                   | Deliverable                               |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 1, 11 (partial) | Detection + announcement     | "Feature detected" → handoff to TDD       |
| 2    | 9, 11 (partial) | Phase tracking + resume      | Ticket `phase:` field, resume mid-feature |
| 3    | 4, 5            | Scenarios (Phase 3-4)        | Draft + validate Given/When/Then          |
| 4    | 2, 3, 11        | Discovery (Phase 0-2)        | Context check + optional spitballing      |
| 5    | 12              | Phase-aware quality (formal) | BDD scenarios for quality hook behavior   |
| 6    | 6, 7, 8, 11     | Implementation (Phase 5-7)   | Outside-in TDD, done checklist            |
| 7    | 10              | Decomposition                | Split suggestions at thresholds           |

- 2026-01-05T03:50:00Z Phase 3: Defined Iteration 3 scenarios (10 scenarios for Phase 3-4 behavior)
- 2026-01-05T00:10:00Z Complete: Iteration 2 - Phase Tracking + Resume (11 scenarios passing)
- 2026-01-05T00:08:00Z Implement: Updated BDD skill with phase tracking and resume logic
- 2026-01-05T00:06:00Z Implement: Added type/phase fields to ticket template with valid values
- 2026-01-05T00:05:00Z Phase 3: Defined Iteration 2 scenarios (11 scenarios for phase tracking + resume)
- 2026-01-04T17:10:00Z Docs: Created schema-registration-guide.md, added /verify-schema command to spec
- 2026-01-04T17:05:00Z Fix: Updated skill-authoring-guide with Schema Registration section to prevent future misses
- 2026-01-04T16:35:00Z Fix: Added BDD skill + /bdd /tdd commands to schema.ts (were missing!), created Cursor rule
- 2026-01-04T16:25:00Z Refactor: Updated all stale references (enforcing-tdd→tdd-enforcing, safeword-bdd→safeword-bdd-orchestrating)
- 2026-01-04T16:20:00Z Refactor: Renamed TDD skill folder to safeword-tdd-enforcing, updated skill authoring guide with keyword-first pattern
