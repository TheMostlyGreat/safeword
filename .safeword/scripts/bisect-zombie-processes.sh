# Bisect zombie processes: Find which test leaves processes behind
#
# Use when: Tests leave processes running, playwright browsers not cleaned up,
# port stays in use after tests, zombie node processes after test suite,
# can't find which test is leaving processes behind, chromium processes accumulate
#
# Usage: ./bisect-zombie-processes.sh <process_pattern> <name_pattern> [search_dir]
# Example: ./bisect-zombie-processes.sh 'chromium' '*.test.ts' tests
# Example: ./bisect-zombie-processes.sh 'node.*:3000' '*.spec.ts' e2e
# Example: ./bisect-zombie-processes.sh 'playwright' '*.test.ts'
