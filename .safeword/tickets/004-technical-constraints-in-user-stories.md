# Technical Constraints in User Stories

**Goal:** Capture non-functional requirements (NFRs) in user stories before test definitions, so tests are informed by performance, security, and compatibility constraints.

**Why:** Without explicit constraints, agents write tests that verify behavior but miss NFRs—resulting in code that "works" but fails in production (slow, insecure, incompatible).

## Work Log

- 2025-11-27T14:30:00Z Complete: All files updated, ready for user confirmation
- 2025-11-27T14:25:00Z Updated: SAFEWORD.md workflow step 1, creation trigger, edge cases
- 2025-11-27T14:20:00Z Updated: tdd-best-practices.md with example including constraints
- 2025-11-27T14:15:00Z Updated: user-story-guide.md with constraints guidance section
- 2025-11-27T14:10:00Z Updated: user-stories-template.md with Technical Constraints section
- 2025-11-27T14:05:00Z Decision: Option A (add to user stories) vs Option B (separate doc) - chose A for simplicity
- 2025-11-27T14:00:00Z Started: User asked about capturing technical requirements before test definitions in TDD
