# SAFEWORD - Claude Code Framework

**Problem**: AI agents write code without tests, skip design validation, and lack consistency across projects.

**Solution**: Portable patterns and guides that enforce TDD workflow, quality standards, and best practices across all your projects.

**Repository**: <https://github.com/TheMostlyGreat/safeword> (private)

---

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**1. Install in your project:**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
bunx safeword@latest setup
```

**2. Verify installation:**

```bash
# Check for SAFEWORD files and hooks
test -f .safeword/SAFEWORD.md && echo ".safeword/SAFEWORD.md ✓"
test -f .claude/settings.json && echo ".claude/settings.json ✓"
```

**Result**: Your project now has:

- `.safeword/SAFEWORD.md` - Global patterns and workflows
- `.safeword/guides/` - TDD methodology, testing, code philosophy
- `.safeword/hooks/` - Claude Code hooks (auto-linting, quality review)
- `.claude/settings.json` - Hook configuration for Claude Code
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands (`/lint`, `/quality-review`, `/drift`)
- `AGENTS.md` - Project context with framework reference (also patches `CLAUDE.md` if it exists)

**Commit these to your repo** for team consistency.

---

## How It Works

**Project-local framework**: Scripts write to `.safeword/` and `.claude/` in your project (no global install needed)

**Team consistency**: Teammates get the framework from your project repo (no global install needed)

**Living documentation**: Update guides as you learn, extract learnings from debugging, archive completed work

---

**What goes here**:

- Debugging discoveries (non-obvious gotchas, integration struggles)
- Trial-and-error findings (tried 3+ approaches before right one)

- Testing traps (tests pass but UX broken, or vice versa)

**How to extract**: Follow `learning-extraction.md` recognition triggers and templates

```

**What goes here**:

---

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Set up safeword in current project
bunx safeword@latest setup
bunx safeword@latest setup -y # Non-interactive mode

# Check project health and versions
bunx safeword@latest check
bunx safeword@latest check --offline # Skip remote version check

# Upgrade to latest version
bunx safeword@latest upgrade

# Preview changes before upgrading
bunx safeword@latest diff
bunx safeword@latest diff -v # Show full diff output

# Remove safeword from project
bunx safeword reset
bunx safeword reset -y     # Skip confirmation
bunx safeword reset --full # Also remove linting config + packages
```

**Auto-detection**: Detects project type from `package.json` and installs relevant ESLint/Prettier plugins:

- TypeScript, React, Next.js, Astro, Vue, Svelte, Electron
- Vitest, Playwright, Tailwind
- Publishable libraries (adds publint)

### How Guide Imports Work

`AGENTS.md` contains a link: `@./.safeword/SAFEWORD.md` (also added to `CLAUDE.md` if present)

SAFEWORD.md then imports guides via the Quick Reference table. Claude Code auto-loads these as context.

### Check for Existing Learnings

```bash
ls .safeword/learnings/
```

### Extract New Learning

1. Follow recognition triggers in `learning-extraction.md`
2. Create `.safeword/learnings/[concept].md`
3. Use template: Problem → Gotcha → Examples → Testing Trap

---

## Syncing Across Machines

Commit `.safeword/` and `.claude/` in your project repo for team consistency.

---

## Integration with Project Context

**How it works**:

1. `AGENTS.md` links to `.safeword/SAFEWORD.md` (also patches `CLAUDE.md` if present)
2. `SAFEWORD.md` imports guides via Quick Reference table
3. Guides cross-reference each other and templates
4. Learnings stored in `.safeword/learnings/`

**Result**: Modular, maintainable documentation with clear separation of concerns

---

## Principles

1. **Guides** - Reusable methodology (test pyramid, TDD workflow)
2. **Templates** - Fillable structures (user stories, test definitions)
3. **Learnings** - Extracted knowledge (gotchas, discoveries)
4. **Planning** - Feature planning and design (user stories, test definitions, design docs)
5. **Hooks/Skills** - Automation and specialized capabilities

**Living Documentation**: Update as you learn, archive completed work, consolidate when needed

## Development

This section is for contributors to safeword itself.

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Runtime   | Bun (dev), Node 18+ (users)   |
| CLI       | TypeScript, Commander.js      |
| Build     | tsup (ESM-only output)        |
| Tests     | Vitest, promptfoo (LLM evals) |
| Linting   | ESLint 9 + Prettier           |

### Optional System Binaries

These tools enhance certain features but are not required:

| Binary  | Purpose                            | Install                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `shfmt` | Shell script formatting in `/lint` | `brew install shfmt`    |
| `dot`   | Dependency graph visualization     | `brew install graphviz` |

Without these binaries, related features gracefully skip or use fallback behavior.

### Development Workflow

**Editing Source Templates:**

1. Edit in `packages/cli/templates/` (source of truth)
2. Run `bunx safeword upgrade` to sync to `.safeword/`
3. Test changes, run evals: `bun run eval`

**Running Tests:**

```bash
# Important: Use `bun run test` (Vitest), NOT `bun test` (Bun's runner)
bun run test                      # All tests
bunx vitest run tests/foo.test.ts # Single file
bun run test:integration          # Integration tests
bun run test:watch                # Watch mode
```

**Publishing:**

Always run `bun publish` from `packages/cli/` directory, not the monorepo root.

### CLI Parity (Claude Code / Cursor)

The CLI installs matching skills for both Claude Code and Cursor IDEs.

**Source of truth:** `packages/cli/src/schema.ts`

**Parity tests:** `packages/cli/tests/schema.test.ts`

| IDE         | Skills Location                | Commands Location       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/safeword-*/`   | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
| Cursor      | `.cursor/rules/safeword-*.mdc` | N/A                     |

**Editing skills:**

1. Edit templates in `packages/cli/templates/skills/` (Claude) and `packages/cli/templates/cursor/rules/` (Cursor)
2. Update `packages/cli/src/schema.ts` if adding/removing skills
3. Run parity tests: `bun run test -- --testNamePattern="parity"`
4. Run `bunx safeword upgrade` to sync to local project

---

## LLM Eval Testing

**Purpose**: Validate that guides are effective for LLM consumption using promptfoo.

### Running Evals

```bash
# Run all eval tests
bun run eval

# Run without cache (fresh API calls)
bun run eval:no-cache

# Open web UI to view results
bun run eval:view
```

### What's Tested

The eval suite tests that LLMs correctly follow guide instructions:

| Category               | Tests   | What's Validated                                                                       |

| Test Definitions       | 12      | Suites, status, naming, mapping, LLM-friendly                                          |
| **Total**              | **154** |                                                                                        |

### Adding New Tests

Edit `promptfoo.yaml` and add a test case:

```yaml
- description: 'test-id: Description'
  vars:
    input: 'User prompt to test'
    context: |
      Relevant excerpt from guide
  assert:
    - type: llm-rubric
      value: |
        EXCELLENT: Best response criteria
        ACCEPTABLE: Minimum passing criteria
        POOR: Failing criteria
```

### Requirements

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable set
- Tests use Claude Sonnet 4 by default

### Interpreting Results

- **PASS**: LLM followed guide correctly
- **FAIL**: Guide may need improvement (clearer instructions, examples, tie-breakers)

Results saved to `eval-results.json` after each run.
